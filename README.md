# ansible-for-devops-notes

## Purpose

This repo aims to gather some notes, cheatsheets and scripts about the book "[Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/)" for one of my master courses.

## Disclaimer

* The content of "Ansible for DevOps" is the property of [@geerlingguy](https://github.com/geerlingguy). However, he had the kindness to produce a [series of videos on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_OBreMn7FqZkvMYt6ATmgC0KAGGJNAN) with his book as a support.
* This repo does not aim to track the latest updates of the book. However, if you want to keep this repo up-to-date, you're welcome to do so.
* Most of the examples you'll find here are most likely available at [the official github repository of the book](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-for-devops).
